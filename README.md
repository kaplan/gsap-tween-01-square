# Playing with the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)

## GreenSock Tween Example
[GreenSock's GSAP][1] is an animation platform for JavaScript. A suite of tools for scripted animation. If you've ever played around with GreenSock's ActionScript Tween Platform this will be very familiar. 

Sometimes gratuitous animation play can teach.

See the animation on this [page][2].
